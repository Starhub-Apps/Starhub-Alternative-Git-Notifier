Git Notifier
==============================

Git Notifier is a Sinatra app that makes possible to receive email notifications for interesting GitHub events.

The supported events are:
- A user stars one of your repositories.
- A user forks one of your repositories.
- A user starts following you.
- A user unfollows you.
- A user that was following you was deleted.

Git Notifier lets a GitHub user signup via OAuth and choose which type of notifications the user wishes to receive and at which frequency (asap, or in a nice daily or weekly report).

You can take a look and use this project in production here: https://gitnotifier.io.

Weekly report example

Installation
------------

This app is fully dockerized, using the same containers for dev, CI and production, on you local env you can use docker-compose like this:

Copy config/docker.env.example to config/docker.env and change the variables, then run:

``` bash
$ docker-compose up # you can use the -d option to run it in background
```

At this point:
- nginx should be listening on port 80 on the host where the docker daemon is running.
- sidekiq will be running.
- puma will be running.
- redis will be running.

After registering a user using the web ui, you can initiate a one off check for new notifications or emails to be sent like this:

```
docker exec githubnotifier_sidekiq_1 bundle exec ruby /usr/src/app/scripts/job_enqueuer.rb
```

There's also a docker file you can use that does this in a while loop, it's `Dockerfile_enqueuer` in the project root.

Deployment
-------

See here: https://github.com/andreausu/gitnotifier-provisioning.

Testing
-------

This project includes casperjs functional tests.

On your local machine, you can run the tests like this:

``` bash
$ casperjs test test/casper/unauthenticated.js
$ casperjs test test/casper/authenticated.js --cookie=the-value-of-the-rack.session-cookie
$ casperjs test test/casper/signup.js --username=githubuser --password=githubpassword # make sure you start with a clean redis db
```

The ultimate goal is to mock the GitHub API calls and Redis calls in order to build a proper unit tests suite, but at least for now those tests make sure that the basic functionality isn't impaired by a broken commit.
